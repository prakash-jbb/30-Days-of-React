# Background Color Changer

This is a simple web application that allows users to change the background color dynamically. It is built using HTML and React with Vite as the build tool.

## Project Structure

The basic HTML structure of the application includes:

- A `div` with the `id` of `root`, where the React app will be rendered.
- A JavaScript module `main.jsx` that is imported to handle the logic of the background color changer.
